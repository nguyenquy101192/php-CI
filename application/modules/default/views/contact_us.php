        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where you have a last ditch attempt
        at getting potential clients, customers and
        fans to get in touch or, in my case,
        convince them otherwise (I get a lot of emails).
        So we’ve had a look at the best About Us pages
        and now I want to do the same for the Contact
        Us page. What are the best practices? What works
        and what doesn’t? Is there anything you can do
        to increase your chances of success?
        Let’s take a look at what I think are 10 of
        the best Contact Us pages on the internet.<br/><br/>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important note on responsive Contact Us pages
        As you might know, the web has now gone mobile.
        People browse websites on their iPhones and iPads
        as much as they do on their laptops and PCs. This
        means we have to change our design to responsive –
        make the website change to the device.<br/><br/>

        <b><i>What makes a good Contact Us page?</i></b><br/><br/>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you guys probably know
        by now, I have a few other online companies that
        keep me busy during the day. One of the things that
        I have found with this non-blog based sites is that
        the contact page can be quite important and can even
        help to set the tone of future relations with your
        clients. It is an important step in the relationship.<br/><br/>

        <b><i>So what makes a good Contact Us page?</i></b><br/><br/>

        Here are some thoughts:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs to work
        At a very basic level, the darn thing needs to work.
        I have been to so many webpages where the contact
        form is broken or doesn’t send properly. Bad look and lost business.
        It needs to grab attention
        Of course, this is the last point whereby a potential
        client can change their mind. If they get sent to a horrible looking contact page you are in trouble. It needs
        to be visually perfect.
        The copy needs to be extremely seductive
        Seductive copy. I do mean that literally. You need to seduce the person reading the page like you would a
        man/woman that you really want to take on a date. Hopefully most of the selling would already have been done if
        they are on the Contact Us page, so this is the tiny little flirt where you get their phone number.
        It needs to set the client up for future relations
        This is really important. You need to establish some ground rules. You need to set the client up for the way
        your relationship is going to work in the future. Statements like, “We check our emails every day and reply even
        if we’re at dinner,” can send very powerful messages.

        Sometimes, just by looking at a good Contact Us page, you can tweak your own so as to increase conversions and
        save a potential lost client. That is the point of this post.
